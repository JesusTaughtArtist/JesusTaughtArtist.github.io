						<h2>Who's Caroline?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I am a self-taught Egyptian artist based in San Francisco, California. I moved from Egypt to the Bay Area during my freshman year of high school. Art was always my passion since as long as I remember. However, it transitioned from a hobby to a business at the beginning of my senior year, when I sold my first painting!
						<br>
						<br>
						I then created my small business, Jesus taught-artist, on Instagram and I started selling my work as a full time artist.

						<h2>What I Do</h2>
					</header>
					<p> I am a rising young-artist who is pursuing art as a career. I am currently a college student, majoring in Studio Art. I paint using mixed media including acrylic, watercolor, and sketching with pencils and charcoal. However, I like painting the most so I consider myself mainly a painter. 
						<br>
						<br>
						I use my love for nature, ocean and most importantly, God, for inspiration throughout my pieces.
